- **Filing Status:** Single
- **Standard Deduction:** $15,000.00
- **Tax Withheld:** $3,000.00
- **Dependents:** 1

## Tax Calculation Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Standard Deduction
- **Standard Deduction:** $15,000.00

### Step 2: Calculate Taxable Income
- **Taxable Income:** 
  \[
  \text{Income} - \text{Standard Deduction} = 50,000 - 15,000 = 35,000
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Tax Liability
- **Tax Brackets for 2023:**
  - 10% on income up to $11,925
  - 12% on income over $11,925 up to $44,725

- **Tax Calculation:**
  - **10% Bracket:**
    \[
    10\% \text{ on } 11,925 = 0.10 \times 11,925 = 1,192.50
    \]
  
  - **12% Bracket:**
    \[
    12\% \text{ on } (35,000 - 11,925) = 12\% \text{ on } 23,075 = 0.12 \times 23,075 = 2,769.00
    \]

- **Total Tax Liability:**
  \[
  1,192.50 + 2,769.00 = 3,961.50
  \]

### Step 4: Apply Dependent Credit
- **Dependent Credit:**
  \[
  1 \text{ dependent} \times 2,000 = 2,000
  \]

- **Adjusted Tax Liability:**
  \[
  3,961.50 - 2,000 = 1,961.50
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate Final Amount
- **Final Amount:**
  \[
  \text{Tax Withheld} - \text{Adjusted Tax Liability} = 3,000 - 1,961.50 = 1,038.50
  \]

## Summary
